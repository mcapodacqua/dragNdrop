		DragNDrop 0.1
Drag&Drop an image in a container, 
Works with HTML5 using the new class FileReader 
to show the base64 code of an image. 
With this way, there are no necessary to upload the image with ajax 
to display it.
If the browser supports HTML5 but the plugin not work, it could be
because the browser doesn't support File Reader( eg Safari 5).
